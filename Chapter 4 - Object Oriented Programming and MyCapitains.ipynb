    "##Â 1. Introduction to Object Oriented Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "**OOP, or Object Oriented Programming**, is a way to write your code. OOP is about code architecture : you define objects that will have instances. For example, the Aeneid text would be an instance of an object Text. OOP is about data modelling : when you think about an object, you need to think \"OK, so now that I have all these texts, what do they have in common ?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "For a Text, it's pretty simple : they have an author (even if it is anonymous), a title (most of the time), a date and a text body. Because texts exist in a vacuum, they have also an incarnation, which is usually realised through a specific method. The edition of the Aeneid available on Perseus, for example, has the following properties :\n",
    "\n",
    "- the method is \"digitized\"\n",
    "- the text is the text\n",
    "- the author is \"Virgil\"\n",
    "- the title is \"Aeneid\"\n",
    "- the age would be about 2000 years.\n",
    "\n",
    "What does this translate to in Python ?\n",
    "\n",
    "    Aeneid = Text(...) #\n",
    "    print(Aeneid.title) # would print \"Aeneid\"\n",
    "    print(Aeneid.author) # = \"Virgil\"\n",
    "    print(type(Aeneid)) # would print \"Text\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The good thing with objects is that the same object can have multiple instances. An **instance** is an emanation of an object, a version of it. Think about the object as a mold. With a mold you can create multiple objects of the same shape that you can paint with different colors. Those are called instances. The Aeneid is an instance of Text. But you could also choose Ovid's Amores :\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    Amores = Text(...) #\n",
    "    print(Amores.title) # would print \"Amores\"\n",
    "    print(Amores.author) # = \"Ovid\"\n",
    "\n",
    "In previous chapters we saw how one object actually has methods and properties (or attributes). **Properties** are value assigned to an object. They're accessible using a dot and the name of the property, such as `Aeneid.title`. **Methods** are functions that use all the information inside an object, *eg* Amores.read() should return a result such as :\n",
    "\n",
    "    Amores, Ovid\n",
    "    text...\n",
    "    \n",
    "To continue with objects, those objects can have children. This means not only do they inherit all the functionalities and properties of the parent, but you will also be able to specify some additional information. For example, Text could have two children named Scroll and Book. Scroll would automatically have a method property set to \"Hand\" and a new method transcript(), while Book would have \"Printed\" and ocr().\n",
    "\n",
    "One last thing : Object is a general name and is often mistaken with `Class`. Every object has a `class` : it is the blueprint of the object. To some extent, if an object is a mold, then the blueprint is the plan required to build that mold. They are so bound together that many people mistake one for the other. The `class` for text, on the other hand, would be responsible for the presence of properties and methods. "
